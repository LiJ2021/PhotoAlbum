For the second project, we will create a photo sharing application. There are no restrictions on what format you choose (instagram-esque single stream, pintrest dynamic height, google image search dynamic width, or similar to our youtube grid page).
We will require you to:
- put the images onto a card
- the site should have a menu
- the site should be responsive
- the photos should link to where you found them, or if they are your photos, they can link to just a random site (until you have your portfolio page live!)
----------------------------------

Im not happy with my site, but I believe it has all of the required elements. For more practice, I chose to make the cards not using bootstrap.
I was researching how to  make the grid containers more dynamic like Corys site, and found a few suggestions, but was unable to get them to work.
I believe it involved align-content inside the card-containers.
